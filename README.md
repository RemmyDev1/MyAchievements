# MyAchievements
My passion for computer programming and technology has encouraged me to keep learning and developing my skills. I aspire to be a top Game Developer or Software Engineer, constantly pushing myself to get better. To further establish my skills, I have taken five Computer Science and Programming CHS & AP courses in high school. I am presently working on developing my own video game, applying my knowledge of game mechanics but also helping others develop their game ideas. I also developed a complete school management system in C++, uploaded to my GitHub. This project showcases my ability to design real-world software programs, and I am looking forward to overcoming new challenges that push the boundaries of my coding life.
